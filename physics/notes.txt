These are CMOS cameras?  or what did you call them?
Anyways, I think we should get used to using them as photon detectors.
For starters, I did this simple trick I thought up on my own.  Take
your phone camera and a TV remote into a closet.  It doesn't have to
be completely dark.  Start the camera on video with the direction
reversed.  Point the phone-camera at its front and push buttons on the
remote.  You see a white circle, maybe bluish or pink.  These remotes
send out infrared, I think.

Along similar DIY lines.  Maybe we can develop a source of ultraviolet
light.  It's a component of sunlight, so maybe just a prism to refract
sunlight enough, or a light bulb. Or a black-light like hippies use?

Better yet, maybe you could modify a photo-electron diode (I mean the
ones that emit, not detect.)
so that it pushes out ultra-violet instead of visible light.  Then we
need a way to detect ultraviolet light - it should be all over the
place.

Me: Is a black light, used by hipsters in the 1960's, giving off
mainly ultra-violet light?

Yes, a black light, which became quite popular in the 1960s for its
psychedelic effects, emits primarily ultraviolet (UV) light.
Specifically, it emits UVA light, which has a wavelength range of
approximately 320 to 400 nanometers. This type of light is just beyond
the visible spectrum, which is why it makes certain materials
fluoresce and appear to glow in the dark while the light itself
appears almost invisible to the naked eye.

Black lights are commonly used in a variety of applications beyond
their iconic use in the '60s, such as for detecting counterfeit
currency, pet urine stains, and forensic purposes.
