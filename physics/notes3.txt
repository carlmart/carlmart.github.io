I have UV laser pointer for my cat and glow in the dark objects
and polarizing filters from an old pair of hippie sunglasses
all I need is a beta barium borate crystal 
ebay $40 https://www.ebay.com/itm/265761835586

Im sure I can get one from a cheap Chinese supplier but I have to look for one

Transparency: BBO crystals have a wide transparency range, from the ultraviolet (185 nm) to the near infrared (3.5 Âµm).
Phase matching: BBO crystals have a broad phase-matching range.
Nonlinear coefficient: BBO crystals have a large nonlinear coefficient.
Damage threshold: BBO crystals have a high damage threshold.
Thermal acceptance bandwidth: BBO crystals have a wide thermal acceptance bandwidth.
Wavefront distortion: BBO crystals have low wavefront distortion.

I am copying the setup at the UMN
