## Experimental Quantum Mechanics
August 2025

Dear Fellow Researchers,

I have been working to understand the particle wave duality in physics. If anyone wants to actually discuss the mathematics, just let me know and we can do a Meetup, Zoom or Whatsapp, or if you still live in Minnesnowta - Live and in Person!

I finally can derive the single photon  wave equation on a single plane, in a vacuum  from Maxwell's Equations, and am drudging along following Zbigniew Ficek's Quantum Physics text book.
It appears that Maxwell's Equations are the key to understanding the photon and  electro-magnetic waves.
It's apparent that there is no real photon, but disturbance in the medium that causes the wave.

What this disturbance is , we shall find out.

Photons have no mass according to Einstein E=MC^2 

Objects with mass   , like quarks and electrons only makes up 1-5% of total mass. Different papers cite different numbers but they all add up to a very small percentage of things we call mass.

What is the 98% else made up of?

Quarks are held together by Energy and its my understanding that when we speak of mass, M=E/C^2 , we really are speaking of Energy divided by C^2. NO MASS, just Energy/C^2
Now about the 1-5% quarks and electrons, where do they get their mass?

Well , thanks to ChatGPT:

```
The relationship between quarks, electrons, and the Higgs field lies in how these fundamental particles acquire mass.

  1. The Higgs Field:
     The Higgs field is an invisible quantum field that permeates all of space. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, particles acquire mass through their interaction with this field.
     The stronger a particle interacts with the Higgs field, the more mass it has.
     This mechanism is called the Higgs mechanism.

  2. Quarks and Electrons in the Higgs Field:
     Both quarks (which make up protons and neutrons) and electrons are fermions (matter particles), and they interact with the Higgs field to acquire mass.

The Process:
  Each fermion type couples to the Higgs field via a Yukawa coupling (a type of interaction).

I was reading about [Physicist David Bohm's](https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Bohm)   work on electron/photon trajectories.
He apparently came up with a description of particles going through the two slit experiment now called The Bohmian Trajectories and what we now call

[Broglie-Bohm Theory or Bohmian Mechanics ](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/)

[David Bohm's ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bohm) work on hidden variables led to the John Bell's work on the Bell Inequality theorem

Here is a short description about Bell and links to his two published papers

[ physics.aps.org/articles/v18/53](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v18/53)

John Bell's  second paper was what got him the Nobel Prize in Physics 2022

Bell took a philosophical  experimental concept and mathematically proved the idea of no hidden variables and brought forth the concepts of quantum entanglement, locality, non-locality and causality  to the forefront of modern quantum physics.

This next link is a bit larger read , but does bring in a new topic (#8) which makes it the more interesting, because it brings forth some philosophical concepts.

[ plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/ ](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/)

"The correlations between a pair of entangled particles — how often both were polarized vertically — could be used to differentiate local hidden-variable theories from quantum mechanics." 

So, the experiment, which by the way , has been proven and published in many prominent journals and which we were planning on conducting 

John Bell's work  disproved the EPR   (Einstein, Podesky, Rosen) thought experiment in which they claimed that Quantum Theory was incomplete due to paradoxes found in the theory. 

Einstein even called non-locality ["Spooky Action at a distance" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance#:~:text=and%20used%20a-,phrase,-translated%20as%20%22spooky)

EPR were Classical Theorists with a new concept of Relativity, so not necessarily on board with Quantum concepts.

Here is the archived description about [EPR thought experiment ](https://archive.ph/Uhulc)

Anyhow, David Bohm helped with the idea of  [proprioception](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception)

Which in turn , the idea of [Holonomic brain theory ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_brain_theory) 

Which describes how consciousness is formed by quantum effects. 

It differs from traditional neuroscience, what some of you study.

What are your thoughts on electric oscillations in the brains dendritic webs instead of axons and synapses?
