August 2025

Though there are numerous published peer reviewed papers describing Quantum Entanglement , where two or more particles become linked in such a way that the state of one particle instantly determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. The Quantum state of each particle cannot be determined independent of the other, even at vast distances. Theoretically and literally, particles that were once connected remain connected through time and space , sharing a common quantum state.
This paper aims to provide a step by step guide to record this quantum state using off the shelf components.


It is important to have have a fundamental understanding of Maxwell's Equations , and to be able to derive the   wave equation on a single plane, in a vacuum for a photon.  

It appears that Maxwell's Equations are the key to understanding the photon and  electro-magnetic waves.
It's apparent that there is no particle photon, rather disturbance in the medium that causes the wave.

Light is a wave, not a particle. Every Quantum and Classical physics article describes it as being a wave.

[Louis Broglie](https://physicsinmyview.com/2024/10/wave-particle-duality-reality-of-quantum-physics.html) had the idea that if photons have dual nature , behaving as wave and particles, then other particles like electrons can have the same characteristics.

In other terms he predicted the wave nature of electrons.


Photons have no mass according to Einstein E=MC^2 

Objects with mass   , like quarks and electrons only makes up 1-5% of total mass. Different papers cite different numbers but they all add up to a very small percentage of things we call mass.

What is the 98% else made up of?

Quarks are held together by Energy and its my understanding that when we speak of mass, M=E/C^2 , we really are speaking of Energy divided by C^2. NO MASS, just Energy/C^2
Now about the 1-5% quarks and electrons, where do they get their mass?

Well , thanks to ChatGPT:

```
The relationship between quarks, electrons, and the Higgs field lies in how these fundamental particles acquire mass.

  1. The Higgs Field:
     The Higgs field is an invisible quantum field that permeates all of space. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, particles acquire mass through their interaction with this field.
     The stronger a particle interacts with the Higgs field, the more mass it has.
     This mechanism is called the Higgs mechanism.

  2. Quarks and Electrons in the Higgs Field:
     Both quarks (which make up protons and neutrons) and electrons are fermions (matter particles), and they interact with the Higgs field to acquire mass.

The Process:
  Each fermion type couples to the Higgs field via a Yukawa coupling (a type of interaction.

First to understand the problem, we start with Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen EPR published paper. 
 - [ Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be considered complete? 1935 ](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.47.777)

EPR paper , a thought experiment intended to demonstrate an [inherent paradox](https://www.thoughtco.com/epr-paradox-in-physics-2699186) in the early formulations of quantum theory. The idea is that two entangled particles can allow for faster than light effects.

"One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete." - Albert Einstein

A mathematical description is given by [Y.D. Chong ](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Quantum_Mechanics/Quantum_Mechanics_III_(Chong)/03%3A_Quantum_Entanglement/3.03%3A_The_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_Paradox) in his paper.

A simpler, but more descriptive  explanation is given by [Sorin Bolos on medium.com](https://medium.com/transilvaniaquantum/a-history-of-the-epr-paradox-and-its-resolution-f3a22f324840)

"We have to deal with pairs of so-called conjugate quantities: the more you know about one the less you know about the other. One example of such a pair is the position and momentum of a quantum particle. Once you know the position of a particle you cannot know anything about its momentum. Once you learn the momentum of the particle you lose any information about its position. The two quantities cannot be known at the same time."

Einstein thought that everything , regardless of quantum or classical physics should be deterministic in nature.


In researching photons I came across 
 [Physicist David Bohm's](https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Bohm)   work on electron/photon trajectories.
He apparently came up with a description of particles going through the two slit experiment now called The Bohmian Trajectories. 

 - [Broglie-Bohm Theory or Bohmian Mechanics ](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/)
 - [David Bohm's work on hidden variables  ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bohm) 

Which in turn led to  John Bell's work on the Bell Inequality theorem

Here is a short description about John Stewart Bell and links to his two published papers.
[ John Bell: The Belfast scientist who proved Einstein wrong](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-29904682)
```
Bell's Theorem - more formally known as 'On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox' - demonstrated that Einstein's views on quantum mechanics - the behaviour of very small things like atoms and subatomic particles - were incorrect.

Bell took a philosophical  experimental concept and mathematically proved the idea of no hidden variables and brought forth the concepts of quantum entanglement, locality, non-locality and causality  to the forefront of modern quantum physics.

This next link is a bit larger read , but does bring in a new topic (#8) which makes it the more interesting, because it brings forth some philosophical concepts.

[ plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/ ](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/)

"The correlations between a pair of entangled particles — how often both were polarized vertically — could be used to differentiate local hidden-variable theories from quantum mechanics." 

So, the experiment, which , as a side note , has been proven and published in many prominent journals and which we are planning on mirroring, disproved the EPR  thought experiment in which they claimed that Quantum Theory was incomplete due to paradoxes found in the theory. 

Einstein even called non-locality ["Spooky Action at a distance" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance#:~:text=and%20used%20a-,phrase,-translated%20as%20%22spooky)

EPR were Classical Theorists with a new concept of Relativity, so not necessarily on board with Quantum concepts, specifically the idea that two particles could instantly communicate, no matter the distance.

Here is the archived description about [EPR thought experiment ](https://archive.ph/Uhulc)

David Bohm helped with the idea of  [proprioception](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception)

Which in turn , the idea of [Holonomic brain theory ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_brain_theory) 

Which describes how consciousness is formed by quantum effects. 

It differs from traditional neuroscience, what some of you study.

What are your thoughts on electric oscillations in the brains dendritic webs instead of axons and synapses?

Now to continue with David Bohm ideas.
```
David Joseph Bohm - thought and distortion of perception
Thought proceeds as if it is merely reporting objectively, but in fact, it is often coloring and distorting perception in unexpected ways. What is required in order to correct the distortions introduced by thought, according to Bohm, is a form of proprioception, or self-awareness. Neural receptors throughout the body inform us directly of our physical position and movement, but there is no corresponding awareness of the activity of thought.
